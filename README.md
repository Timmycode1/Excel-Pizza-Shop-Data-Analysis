# Pizza Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data from a pizza shop to gain insights into various aspects of its operations. By examining key performance indicators (KPIs), trends, and patterns in the data, we aim to provide valuable insights that can inform decision-making and optimization strategies for the business.

## Data Source

### Description:
The data used in this analysis is sourced from an Excel file containing pizza sales data.


### Accessing the Data:
- The Google Sheets file can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S6_o65KXbAFXZasn_yNOhytmeu4ITcFW/edit?usp=sharing).


### Data Structure:
- **pizza_id**: Unique identifier for each pizza sold.
- **order_id**: Unique identifier for each order.
- ...

  ## Tools Used

### Excel:
- **Data Source:** The primary data source for this analysis was an Excel file containing pizza sales data.
- **Data Management:** Excel was used to store and manage the raw data, including order information, pizza names, quantities, prices, dates, and times.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Tasks such as cleaning, sorting, and organizing the data were performed in Excel to prepare it for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Excel's spreadsheet capabilities were utilized for filtering, sorting, and basic calculations to understand the data's characteristics.
- **Visualization:** Summary statistics and basic visualizations may have been generated in Excel to provide initial insights into the data.

### SQL:
- **Data Extraction:** SQL (Structured Query Language) was used to extract and manipulate data from the Excel file for analysis.
- **Query Writing:** SQL queries were written to retrieve specific subsets of data based on criteria such as date ranges, pizza categories, sizes, and order details.
- **Aggregation and Analysis:** Aggregation functions and GROUP BY clauses in SQL were used to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, average order value, total pizzas sold, and more.
- **Insights Generation:** SQL queries were used to generate insights into sales trends, peak order times, sales distribution by category and size, best-selling and least-selling pizzas, and other relevant aspects of the data.


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the initial stages of the project, we conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the pizza sales dataset. Here are some questions we explored:

1. **What is the distribution of total revenue over time?**
   - Visualized the trend of total revenue over different time periods using line plots.

2. **How does the average order value vary by day of the week?**
   - Calculated the average order value for each day of the week and visualized it using bar charts.

3. **What are the top-selling pizza categories and sizes?**
   - Identified the most popular pizza categories and sizes based on the quantity sold using bar charts.

4. **Is there a correlation between order quantity and total price?**
   - Examined the relationship between order quantity and total price using scatter plots and calculated the correlation coefficient.

5. **How does the distribution of sales differ between weekdays and weekends?**
   - Compared the distribution of sales between weekdays and weekends using histograms.

6. **Are there any seasonal trends in pizza sales?**
   - Explored the sales data over different months or seasons and looked for patterns using line plots or heatmaps.

7. **What are the peak order times during the day?**
   - Analyzed the distribution of order times and identified peak hours using histograms or density plots.

8. **How do sales vary between different pizza names or ingredients?**
   - Compared sales performance between different pizza names or ingredients using bar charts or box plots.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis of the pizza sales data, the following recommendations are suggested to optimize business performance and enhance customer satisfaction:

1. **Promotional Strategies:**
   - Implement targeted promotions or discounts during off-peak hours to increase sales during quieter periods.

2. **Menu Optimization:**
   - Expand the menu offerings based on the popularity of classic pizzas and XLarge sizes. Introduce new variations or specialty pizzas to attract a wider range of customers.

3. **Inventory Management:**
   - Adjust inventory levels based on sales trends to ensure optimal stock availability during peak hours, especially on weekends and evenings.

4. **Customer Engagement:**
   - Enhance customer engagement and loyalty programs to encourage repeat business. Offer rewards or discounts for frequent customers or referrals.

5. **Operational Efficiency:**
   - Streamline order processing and delivery operations to handle peak periods more efficiently. Consider implementing technology solutions such as online ordering systems or delivery tracking apps to improve customer experience.

6. **Menu Engineering:**
   - Analyze the performance of individual menu items to identify best-selling and least-selling items. Consider discontinuing or repositioning underperforming items to optimize menu profitability.

7. **Staffing Optimization:**
   - Adjust staffing levels based on peak hours and demand patterns to ensure adequate coverage during busy periods while minimizing costs during slower times.

8. **Customer Feedback:**
   - Gather feedback from customers to identify areas for improvement and address any concerns or issues promptly. Use customer feedback to continuously refine and enhance the overall dining experience.

These recommendations aim to optimize operations, attract more customers, and improve overall business performance for the pizza shop.
